              <p> Lecture classes will meet Sundays, 10:30-11:20, and are attended by the entire class.
                  The lectures are designed to introduce students to major milestones in World History,
                  as well as to introduce students to basic terms/concepts used in the historical profession.
                  They will also provide the bulk of the content tested in the quizzes and the Final exam:

                  for note taking and/or accessing online readings. </p>
   
              <p> In the Workshop classes, which will take place Tuesday mornings or afternoons (check your schedule for when), the class will be broken down into smaller sections of about 20, and will meet with either the professor or the teaching assistant. In the workshop classes, students will work with the instructors on developing crucial course skills like note taking, essay writing, proper citation of sources, and research habits. The 3 course quizzes will take place during workshop classes, as well as debates, in-class assignments, etc. In general, the workshop sessions focus on team work, and more class participation points will be assigned to successful teams. </p>
   
              <p> Discussion sections will meet on Thursday mornings or afternoons (check your schedule for when), the class will again be broken down into smaller sections of about 20, and will meet with either one of the main instructors or the teaching assistant. Discussion sections will mainly revolve around class discussion of the assigned document. Students are expected to read the documents- which are be accessed from links on this web site- and to think over the assigned discussion questions before coming to class. During discussion sections, students are expected to demonstrate their critical thinking skills by participating actively engaging in an analytical discussion of the assigned materials- students must be prepared to answer questions posed to them, as well as ask informed questions and raise relevant issues about the text. In particular, students are encouraged to consider the content and style of the document: for example, what was goal of the author, what are his/her biases, and what was the intended audience? Most importantly, what does this document tell us about the culture which produced it? Students who participate actively in the class discussion will earn class participation points. </p>

              <p>
                There are two types of short assignments in this class:  2 pass/fail assignments and 6 short essays.
              </p>
   
              <p>
                The pass/fail worksheets are due at the times specified by the course calendar. These assignments will earn the student an automatic 100% when completed to the instructor’s satisfaction; if not, they will be returned to the students for revision, with comments.
              </p>
   
              <p>
                In addition, students must turn in a total of 6 short one-page essay assignments, at least 3 of which must be submitted before the middle of the semester (see the course schedule below). Each of these essays must answer one of the “discussion questions” listed at the top of the week’s readings. Click on any of the “discussion” listings below to see a sample list of questions. The assignments must be submitted at the recitation sections that discuss the assigned source. Students may only submit one question per week; this means that students had better start early and submit at least one every other week or else they will run out of time by the semester’s end. Students must answer the questions in an essay format, with a clearly-articulated one-paragraph introduction, several body paragraphs to support that introduction, and a brief conclusion. The short assignments will be graded on your ability to formulate a convincing argument, firmly based on evidence from the attached document, which clearly addresses the question asked.

                  Students must complete one long research paper of approximately 6-8 pages length and utilizing 3-5 academic sources. In the term paper, students will be graded on clarity, style, and the use of appropriate evidence to defend a clearly-articulated argument (click here for the rubric, which is the same as the short assignments). Purely narrative papers- which tell a story rather than analyzing an issue- will receive poor grades. Again, please do not hesitate to contact myself or the Academic Resource Center for help.

Students will learn more about collecting and assessing documents for their term paper in the Carnegie Skills Workshop course, which is paired with this class.

                <p>
                  Given the requirement for written sources, students are expected to take initiative and order sources as soon as possible in the semester through interlibrary loan.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The second pass-fail assignment is designed to help students prepare for the term paper assignment, and we will also spend some time doing term paper prep activities in the Workshop sessions of the class.

                <li> Downloading a paper, wholly or partially, from the internet </li>

                  At three designated “workshop” days during the semester, class will start with a short “term linking quiz”, where students will be expected to show mastery of concepts taught in class up to that point by making linkages between different concepts drawn from the Sunday course lectures. During the quiz, students will be presented with pairs of these terms and asked to describe, in no more than a paragraph, the relationship between the terms. There is no set right or wrong answers on these quizzes, but to achieve high marks, students must come up with a convincing link between the two terms and defend it with a persuasive argument. Students who only define the two terms, but do not link them, will receive no more than half marks. <a href="Resources/Sample%20Paired%20Term%20Essay%20Answers.html">Click here for an example of possible answers to a typical set of paired terms</a>, and <a href="Resources/studyterms.htm.html"> click here for a list of terms that will be covered in this class </a>.

                  The final exam will be given during finals week at a time and location TBD and will cover material from the lectures, reading, and discussion sections for the first half of the course. All you need to bring to the exams are two pens; examination “bluebooks” will be provided. Make-up examinations will only be given in the case of illness or a serious family emergency, and notification must be given in writing.  Each exam will consist of two parts, term matching and essay. The term matching section will be identical to the term matching quizzes, though it will cover material for the entire course. In the essay section, students will be presented with a short document, either primary or secondary, and then students must choose and answer one of a number of essay questions requiring them to relate that document to materials covered in lecture and other documents we have read in class. This portion of the exam is to test skills that students should be developing during the recitation sections and short essays. Grading will follow the grading rubric for essays (<a href="Resources/Essayrubric.htm.html">click here for the rubric</a>). <a href="Resources/studyterms.htm.html"> Click HERE for a list of all terms that will be covered in the class</a>.

                <p>
                  Students are expected to participate actively in both the workshop and the discussion sections; see above for more details. Students can guarantee themselves full class participation marks if they come to discussion sections well prepared (with the readings or other assigned materials in hand) and are ready to speak, and listen, to other students. It is not necessary to have brilliant insights every week to receive high marks- regular attendance and active, informed participation will be sufficient.

                <p> 
                  Class participation is grades as follows. Attendance in lecture is not counted (but you will suffer in the quizzes and exam if you skip).In workshops, attendance (with the class materials) is worth 1 mark, while successful completion of a competition earns all members of the winning team 1 mark. In recitation, attendance (with the class materials) is worth1 mark, while meaningful participation in the discussion will earn 2 or even 3 marks. At midterm and final each student’s marks will be tallied and then located on a bell curve. Students who get an average number of aggregate marks will get an average class participation grade (“average” to be defined by the instructors at the time grades are assigned). Those with higher than average and lower than average marks will earn higher or lower class participation grades, and thus higher or lower fractions of the 20-points contributed by class participation to their overall grade.

After the third day the student will receive a 0 on the assignment.
