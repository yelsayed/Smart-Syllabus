</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;font-weight:normal;

Huang, Ana Cordova, and Marcia Pimentel </span><span style="font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:Arial;font-weight:normal;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold"><o:p></o:p></span></h1>

<p><span style="font-family:Arial"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Arial">As the world population continues to grow
geometrically, great pressure is being placed on arable land, water, energy,
and biological resources to provide an adequate supply of food while
maintaining the integrity of our ecosystem. According to the World Bank and the
United Nations, from 1 to 2 billion humans are now malnourished, indicating a
combination of insufficient food, low incomes, and inadequate distribution of
food. This is the largest number of hungry humans ever recorded in history. In <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">China</st1:place></st1:country-region> about 80
million are now malnourished and hungry. Based on current rates of increase,
the world population is projected to double from roughly 6 billion to more than
12 billion in less than 50 years (Pimentel et al., 1994). As the world
population expands, the food problem will become increasingly severe,
conceivably with the numbers of malnourished reaching 3 billion. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Arial">Based on their evaluations of available
natural resources, scientists of the Royal Society and the U.S. National
Academy of Sciences have issued a joint statement reinforcing the concern about
the growing imbalance between the world's population and the resources that
support human lives (RS and NAS, 1992). <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Arial">Reports from the Food and Agricultural
Organization of the United Nations, numerous other international organizations,
and scientific research also confirm the existence of this serious food
problem. For example, the per capita availability of world grains, which make
up 80 per cent of the world's food, has been declining for the past 15 years
(Kendall and Pimentel, 1994). Certainly with a quarter million people being
added to the world population each day, the need for grains and all other food
will reach unprecedented levels. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Arial">More than 99 per cent of the world's food
supply comes from the land, while less than 1 per cent is from oceans and other
aquatic habitats (Pimentel et al., 1994). The continued production of an
adequate food supply is directly dependent on ample fertile land, fresh water,
energy, plus the maintenance of biodiversity. As the human population grows,
the requirements for these resources also grow. Even if these resources are
never depleted, on a per capita basis they will decline significantly because
they must be divided among more people. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Arial">At present, fertile <span class="GramE">cropland,</span>
is being lost at an alarming rate. For instance, nearly one-third of the
world's cropland (1.5 billion hectares) has been abandoned during the past 40
years because erosion has made it unproductive (Pimentel et al., 1995). Solving
erosion losses is a long-term problem: it takes 500 years to form 25 mm of soil
under agricultural conditions. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Arial">Most replacement of eroded agricultural land
is now coming from marginal and forest land. The pressure for agricultural land
accounts for 60 to 80 percent of the world's deforestation. Despite such land
replacement strategies, world cropland per capita has been declining and is now
only 0.27 ha per capita; in China only 0.08 ha now is available. This is only
15 per cent of the 0.5 ha per capita considered minimal for a diverse diet
similar to that of the <st1:country-region w:st="on">U.S.</st1:country-region>
and <st1:place w:st="on">Europe</st1:place>. The shortage of productive
cropland combined with decreasing land productivity is, in part, the cause of
current food shortages and associated human malnutrition. Other factors such as
political unrest, economic insecurity, and unequal food distribution patterns
also contribute to food shortages. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Arial">Water is critical for all crops which
require and transpire massive amounts of water during the growing season. For
example, a hectare of corn will transpire more than 5 million liters of water
during one growing season. This means that more than 8 million liters of water
per hectare must reach the crop. In total, agricultural production consumes
more fresh water than any other human activity. Specifically, about 87 per cent
of the world's fresh water is consumed or used up by agriculture and, thus, is
not recoverable (Pimentel et al., 1996). <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Arial">Competition for water resources among individuals,
regions, and countries and associated human activities is already occurring
with the current world population. About 40 percent of the world's people live
in regions that directly compete for shared water resources. In <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">China</st1:place></st1:country-region> where
more than 300 cities already are short of water, these shortages are
intensifying. Worldwide, water shortages are reflected in the per capita
decline in irrigation used for food production in all regions of the world
during the past twenty years. Water resources, critical for irrigation, are
under great stress as populous cities, states, and countries require and
withdraw more water from rivers, lakes, and aquifers every year. A major threat
to maintaining future water supplies is the continuing over-draft of surface
and ground water resources. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Arial">Diseases associated with water rob people of
health, nutrients, and livelihood. This problem is most serious in developing
countries. For example, about 90 per cent of the diseases occurring in
developing countries result from a lack of clean water (Pimentel et al., 1996).
Worldwide, about 4 billion cases of disease are contracted from water and
approximately 6 million deaths are caused by water-borne disease each year.
When a person is ill with diarrhea, malaria, or other serious disease, anywhere
from 5 to 20 percent of an individual's food intake offsets the stress of the
disease. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Arial">Disease and malnutrition problems in the
third world appear to be as serious in rural areas as they are in urban areas,
especially among the poor. This will intensify in the future. Furthermore, the
number of people living in urban areas is doubling every 10 to 20 years,
creating major environmental problems, including water and air pollution and
increased disease and food shortages. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Arial">Fossil energy is another prime resource used
for food production. Nearly 80 per cent of the world's fossil energy used each
year is used by the developed countries, and part of it is expended in
producing high animal protein diets. The intensive farming technologies of developed
countries use massive amounts of fossil energy for fertilizers, pesticides,
irrigation, and for machines as a substitute for human labor. In developing
countries, fossil energy has been used primarily for fertilizers and irrigation
to help maintain yields rather than to reduce human labor inputs (<span class="SpellE">Giampietro</span> and Pimentel, 1993). <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Arial">Because fossil energy is a finite resource,
its depletion accelerates as population needs for food and services escalate.
The <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region>
is already importing more than 50 per cent of its oil, and projections from the
U.S. Department of Energy indicate that the country will exhaust all of its oil
reserves within the next 15 to 20 years (Pimentel et al., 1994). Oil imports
will then have to increase, worsening the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region> trade imbalance. <span class="GramE">As supplies of fossil energy dwindle, the cost of fuel increases
everywhere.</span> The impact of this is already a serious problem for
developing countries where the high price of imported fossil fuel makes it
difficult, if not impossible, for poor farmers to power irrigation and provide
for their other agricultural needs. Worldwide, per capita supplies of fossil
energy show a significant decline. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Arial">In general, developing countries have been
relying heavily on fossil energy, especially for fertilizers and irrigation to
augment their food supply. The current decline in per capita use of fossil
energy, caused by the gradual decline in oil supplies and their relatively high
prices, is generating direct competition between developed and developing
countries for fossil energy resources. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Arial">Economic analyses often overlook the
biological and physical constraints that exist in all food production systems.
The assumption is that market mechanisms and international trade are effective
insurances against future food shortages. A rich economy is expected to
guarantee a food supply adequate to meet a country's demand despite existing
local ecological constraints. In fact, the contrary is true. When global
biological and physical limits to domestic food production are reached, food importation
will no longer be a viable option for any country. At that point, food
importation for the rich can only be sustained by starvation of the powerless
poor. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Arial">These concerns about the future are
supported by two observations. First, most of the 183 nations of the world are
now, to some extent, dependent on food imports. Most of these imports are
cereal surpluses produced only in those countries that have relatively low
population densities and practice intensive agriculture. For instance, the <st1:country-region w:st="on">United States</st1:country-region>, <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>,
<st1:country-region w:st="on">Australia</st1:country-region>, Oceania, and <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Argentina</st1:place></st1:country-region>
provide 81 percent of net cereal exports on the world market. If, as projected,
the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region>
population doubles in the next 60 years (Pimentel et al., 1994), then its
cereal and other food resources would have to be used domestically to feed 520
million hungry Americans. Then the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region> would cease to be a food
exporting country. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Arial">In the future, when exporting nations must
keep surpluses at home, <st1:country-region w:st="on">Egypt</st1:country-region>,
<st1:country-region w:st="on">Jordan</st1:country-region>, and countless other
countries in Africa and <st1:place w:st="on">Asia</st1:place> will be without
the food imports that now help them survive. <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">China</st1:place></st1:country-region>, which now imports many tons
of food, illustrates this problem. As the <span class="SpellE">Worldwatch</span>
Institute has pointed out, if China's population increases by 500 million and
their soil erosion continues unabated, it will need to import 200-400 million
tons of food each year by 2050 (Brown, 1995). But by then, sufficient food
imports probably will not be available on the international market. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Arial">Certainly improved technology will assist in
more effective management and use of resources, but it cannot produce an
unlimited flow of those vital natural resources that are the raw materials for
sustained agricultural production. For instance, fertilizers enhance the
fertility of eroded soils, but humans cannot make topsoil. Indeed, fertilizers
made from finite fossil fuels are presently being used to compensate for eroded
topsoil. Per capita fish catch has not increased even though the size and speed
of fishing vessels has improved. On the contrary, per capita fish production is
lower than ever before because greater efficiency led to overfishing. In
regions like eastern <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Canada</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
overfishing has been so severe that cod fishermen have no fish to catch, and
the economy of that region has been devastated. All of the world's fishing
grounds are facing overfishing problems. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Arial">Consider also the supplies of fresh water
that are available not only for agriculture but also for industry and public
use. Water withdrawn from the Colorado River in several states for irrigation
and other purposes results in the river being nearly dry by the time it reaches
the <st1:placetype w:st="on">Sea</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename w:st="on">Cortes</st1:placename>,
<st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Mexico</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
No available <span class="GramE">technology can</span> double the flow of the <st1:place w:st="on">Colorado River</st1:place>, although effective water conservation
would be a help. Similarly, the shrinking ground water resources stored in vast
aquifers cannot be refilled by human technology. Rainfall is the only supplier.
<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Arial">A productive and sustainable agricultural
system depends on maintaining the integrity of biodiversity. Often small in
size, diverse species are natural enemies of pests, degrade wastes, form soil,
fix nitrogen, pollinate crops, etc. For example, in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:placename w:st="on">New York</st1:placename> <st1:placetype w:st="on">State</st1:placetype></st1:place>
on one bright, sunny day in July, the wild and other bees pollinate an
estimated 6,000,000 million blossoms of essential fruits and vegetables. Humans
have no technology to substitute for many of the services provided by diverse
species in our environment. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Arial">Strategies for the future must be based
first and foremost on the conservation and careful management of land, water,
energy, and biological resources needed for food production. Our stewardship of
world resources must change and the basic needs of people must be balanced with
those resources that sustain human life. The conservation of these resources
will require coordinated efforts and incentives from individuals and countries.
Once these finite resources are exhausted they cannot be replaced by human
technology. Further, more efficient and environmentally sound agricultural
technologies must be developed and put into practice to support the continued
productivity of agriculture. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style="margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><span style="font-family:Arial">Yet
none of these measures will be sufficient to ensure adequate food supplies for
future generations unless the growth in the human population is simultaneously curtailed.
Several studies have confirmed that to maintain a relatively high standard of
living, the optimum population should be less than 200 million for the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region> and less
than 2 billion for the world (Pimentel et al., 1994). This assumes that from
now until an optimum population is achieved, strategies for the conservation of
land, water, energy, and biological resources are successfully implemented and
a sound, productive environment is protected. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

linked to height. By what standard is the earth overpopulated? <span class="GramE">Certainly not living space.</span> The world's population could fit
into <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:city w:st="on">Jacksonville</st1:city>, <st1:state w:st="on">Florida</st1:state></st1:place>, with everyone having standing room.
Dense cities are often surrounded by nearly empty <span class="SpellE">countrysides</span>.
For overpopulation to be <span class="GramE">real,</span> there must be
conditions that are undesirable and unmistakably caused by the presence of a
certain number of people. If such indications cannot be found, we are entitled
to dismiss the claim of overpopulation. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">In arguing their case, the
believers in overpopulation make vague, tautological references to a standard
known as "carrying capacity" colorfully illustrated with stories

resource depletion.</span> Yet on no count does the evidence support the
anti-population lobby's case. On the contrary, the long-term trend for each
factor is positive and points to an even better future. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">The television pictures of
starving, emaciated Africans are heartbreaking, but they are not evidence of
overpopulation. Since 1985 we have witnessed famine in <st1:country-region w:st="on">Ethiopia</st1:country-region>, <st1:country-region w:st="on">Sudan</st1:country-region>,
and <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Somalia</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
Those nations have one thing in common: they are among the least densely populated
areas on earth. Although their populations are growing, the people there are
not hungry because the world can't produce enough food. They are hungry because
civil war keeps food from getting to them. Moreover, the very sparseness of
their populations makes them vulnerable to famine because there are
insufficient people to support sophisticated roads and transportation systems
that would facilitate the movement of food. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">In the 20th century there
has been no famine that has not been caused by civil war, irrational economic
policies, or political retribution. Not one. Moreover, the number of people
affected by famine compared to that in the late 19th century has fallen--not
just as a percentage of the world's population but in absolute numbers. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><span style="font-family:Arial">Food Supply<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">Food is abundant. Since
1948, according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization and the U.S.
Department of Agriculture, annual world food production has outpaced the
increase in population. Today, per capita production and per-acre yields are at
all-time highs. Prices of agricultural products have been falling for over 100
years. The average inflation-adjusted price of those products, indexed to
wages, fell by more than 74 percent between 1950 and 1990. While Lester Brown
of the <span class="SpellE">Worldwatch</span> Institute and the noted butterfly
expert Paul Ehrlich predict higher food prices and increasing scarcity, food is
becoming cheaper and more plentiful. That good news is due largely to
technological advances (the "green revolution") that have provided
better seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, and methods of farming. The only
obstacles to agricultural progress are the impediments created by governments.
Imagine what the world would be like today if the fertile farmland of the
former Soviet Union or <st1:country-region w:st="on">China</st1:country-region>
or <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
had been in productive private hands operating in free markets for the past
several decades. Since permitting market incentives in agriculture, <st1:country-region w:st="on">India</st1:country-region> has been come a net food exporter and
agricultural production in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">China</st1:place></st1:country-region>
has boomed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">Catastrophists argue that
the bright past does not imply a bright future; they arbitrarily assert that
mankind has crossed some fateful threshold. But the earth is capable of feeding
many more people than are now alive. The late Roger <span class="SpellE">Revelle</span>
of <st1:placename w:st="on">Harvard</st1:placename> <st1:placetype w:st="on">University</st1:placetype>
(whom Gore claims as a mentor) estimated that Africa, Asia, and <st1:place w:st="on">Latin America</st1:place> alone, simply by using water more
efficiently, could feed 35 to 40 billion people--seven to eight times the
current world population. And that assumes no change in technology--a
groundless assumption, to be sure. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">Those who annually predict
imminent famine (while urging readers to subscribe to next year's publications)
seize on any change as evidence that man's alleged strain on the biosphere is
finally beginning to show. Thus, if the price of seafood rises, they announce
that the seas are nearing exhaustion. They never consider the myriad other
possibilities, such as the shift in diet from meat to fish, the decline of the
Russian fishing industry during the dissolution of the Soviet Union, or the
"tragedy of the commons" associated with the lack of property rights
in the oceans and lakes. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">The most telling indication
of the trend in food production is the presence of a farm lobby in every industrial
capital. Those lobbies spend millions of dollars a year to persuade their
governments to hold food prices up and food supplies down. They apparently
don't expect help from nature. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><span style="font-family:Arial">Plunging Death Rate<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">The catastrophists' claim
that the population explosion causes famine, poverty, disease, and
environmental degradation founders on a single undeniable fact: the global
plunge in the death rate. All over the world, people are living longer. More
babies survive infancy than ever before, and more people are reaching old age.
That cannot be squared with the assertion that living standards are falling,
that food production is declining, and that the air and water are more
dangerous to human life. "Human comfort," wrote John Rickman, a
contemporary chronicler of the Industrial Revolution, "is to be estimated
by human health, and that by the length of human life." <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">It should be unnecessary to
emphasize the increase in longevity: without it there would be no population
explosion for the catastrophists to complain of. The increase in the number of
human beings has not occurred because women are having more children than
before. The increase is chiefly the result of the falling mortality rate, which
economist Julian Simon calls "man's triumph over death." It should be
the occasion for celebration, but the catastrophists prefer sackcloth. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">In the period 1950-55, there
were 159 infant deaths per 1,000 live births in the developing world. By
1980-85, the number plunged by over 42 percent--to 92. In <st1:place w:st="on">East
 Asia</st1:place>, infant mortality dropped 71 percent. In <st1:place w:st="on">South
 America</st1:place>, the drop averaged 52 percent. Even in <st1:place w:st="on">Africa</st1:place>,
the world's laggard, infant mortality dropped 38 percent. In the industrialized
world, the rate fell more than 69 percent. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">The increase in life
expectancy at birth has been equally dramatic. Between 1950-55 and 1980-85, the
average increase worldwide was 13 years, up 29 percent. In the industrialized
world, life expectancy went from 65 years to 73 years. But the biggest news was
in the developing world, where the increase went from 41 to over 56--a 38
percent increase. The most dramatic increases were in <st1:place w:st="on">East
 Asia</st1:place>, where more than 25 years were added to peoples' lives (for a
total of 68 years), a 60 percent gain. In South America there was an average
gain of almost 11 years, and in <st1:place w:st="on">Africa</st1:place> the
gain was over 12 years. "The increase in average life expectancy during
the twentieth century," the late David <span class="SpellE">Osterfeld</span>
wrote in Progress versus Planning: How Government Stifles Economic <span class="GramE">Growth,</span> "equals or exceeds the gains made in all the
preceding centuries combined." In A Moment on the Earth, Gregg Easterbrook
points out that "it cannot be noted too often that the spectacular
worldwide increase in human <span class="SpellE">lifespans</span> has come during
the very period when global use of synthetic chemicals, fossil fuels,
high-yield agriculture, and radioactive substances has increased
exponentially--a fantastic flowering of life coincident with the very
influences doomsday orthodoxy depicts as antithetical to life." <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><span style="font-family:Arial">Falling Fertility Rate <o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">Over that same period, the
total fertility rate (the average number of children born per woman) fell
everywhere. Worldwide, the rate fell from 5 to 3.6. (The rate that produces
population stability, or replacement, is 2.1.) The developing world's rate dropped
from 6.2 to 4.1--more than halfway to the replacement rate. East Asia went from
5.5 to 2.3, <st1:place w:st="on">South America</st1:place> from 4.9 to 3.6. The
laggard, again, is <st1:place w:st="on">Africa</st1:place>, where the rate fell
from 6.5 to only 6.4. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">Thus, the world's population
has been heading toward stabilization for 30 years. The population controllers
will credit that to their efforts (while complaining that not enough is being
done). But there is a simpler explanation: as economies develop and people
become better off materially, they have fewer children. That phenomenon, known
as the demographic transition, is well established in demography. It explains
what happened in the West, where today the fertility rate is 2.0 or
lower--below replacement rate. The demographic transition makes perfect sense.
In preindustrial, agricultural economies, children provide farm labor and
social security (sons care for their elderly parents); children are wealth. In
a developed economy, parents invest resources (for education and the like) in
their children; they are an expense. As societies become <span class="GramE">Westernized</span>,
and as modern consumer goods and services become available, people find sources
of satisfaction other than children. So they have fewer kids. A falling
infant-mortality rate also reduces a society's fertility rate. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">Thus, a low fertility rate,
writes Peter Bauer, is an effect, not a cause, of development. Arguments for
population control programs in the developing world, which shift child-bearing
decisions from couples to the state, are wrong. Those programs are also an
affront to human dignity, privacy, and liberty, whether they compel women to
have abortions and to be sterilized (as they do in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region w:st="on">China</st1:country-region></st1:place>) or "merely"
deprive people of income and vital services because they want more children
than the government wishes. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><span style="font-family:Arial">No Obstacle to Development <o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">The catastrophists' <span class="SpellE">cliche</span> that a growing population is an obstacle to
development is especially barren. Studies show a strong correlation between
affluence and longevity; as the late Aaron <span class="SpellE">Wildavsky</span>
liked to say, wealthier is healthier. The lengthening life expectancy in the
developing world is evidence that population growth cannot be increasing
poverty. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">History makes the same
point. The West grew rich precisely when its population was increasing at an
unprecedented rate. Between 1776 and 1975, while the world's population
increased <span class="SpellE">sixfold</span>, real gross world product rose
about 80-fold. In our own century we have seen a replay of the Industrial
Revolution. After World War II the population of Hong Kong grew more quickly than
that of 19th-century <st1:country-region w:st="on">England</st1:country-region>
or 20th-century <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region w:st="on">India</st1:country-region></st1:place>--at
the same time that resource-poor island-colony was growing rich. The increases
in population and wealth have not been merely coincidental. They are causes and
effects of each other. Today, with few exceptions, the most densely populated
countries are the richest. Any mystery in that is dispelled by the realization
that people are the source of ideas. The addition of people geometrically
increases the potential for combining ideas into newer, better ideas. As the
Nobel laureate and economist Simon Kuznets wrote, "More population means
more creators and producers, both of goods along established production
patterns and of new knowledge and inventions." A growing population also
allows for a more elaborate division of labor, which raises incomes. Those who
wish to stifle population growth would condemn hundreds of millions of people
in the developing world to the abject deprivation that characterized the West
before the Industrial Revolution. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">The initially plausible
claim that more people deplete resources faster has no more foundation than the
catastrophists' other arguments. Price is the best indication of relative
scarcity. For centuries, resources of every kind, including energy, have been
getting cheaper. In 1990 energy on average was 46 percent cheaper that it was
in 1950; minerals were 48 percent cheaper, lumber 41 percent cheaper, food 74
percent cheaper. As Carroll Ann Hodges, of the U.S. Geological Survey, wrote in
the June 2, 1995, issue of Science (pp. 1305-1312), "Yet, despite the
specter of scarcity that has prevailed throughout much of this century, no
sustained mineral shortages have occurred. . . .Minerals essential to
industrial economies are not now in short supply, nor are they likely to be for
the next several generations." (The only thing getting more expensive is
labor, an indication of the scarcity of people.) Technology enables us to find
more resources and to use them more efficiently. Doubling the efficiency of our
use of oil would be equivalent to doubling the available supply of oil. Natural
resources, in other words, do not exist in fixed supplies. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><span style="font-family:Arial">Resources: Natural or Manmade? <o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">Actually, natural resources do
not exist at all. All resources are manmade. Something is not a resource until
it can accomplish a human purpose. Before Benjamin Silliman, Jr., a <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:placename w:st="on">Yale</st1:placename> <st1:placetype w:st="on">University</st1:placetype></st1:place>
chemist, discovered in 1855 that kerosene (a better illuminant than whale oil)
could be distilled from crude oil, oil was not a resource. It was black gunk
that ruined farmland and had to be removed at great expense. Silliman turned
oil into a resource not by changing its chemical composition but by making a
discovery. Nature does not provide resources, only materials. A resource is a
material that has been stamped with a human purpose. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">The latest evidence of that
truth is the information revolution that swirls around us. That revolution is
made possible by silicon computer chips and threads of glass (fiber-optic
cables). Both are made from sand--one of the most abundant substances on the
planet. Thanks to human ingenuity, a common substance that was merely part of
the landscape has become a tool of revolutionary human advancement. People don't
deplete resources. They create them. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><span style="font-family:Arial">Institutions Count <o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">Nothing written here implies
that population growth does not bring problems. Quite the contrary; but as
Julian Simon says, it also brings problem solvers who apply their intelligence,
discover and invent solutions, and--here is the key--leave human society better
off than it was before the problems arose. Doubters need only study the quality
of life on the pre-Columbian North American continent, when several million
Indians barely scratched out their subsistence amid the same "natural
resources" that today enrich the lives of billions of people worldwide. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">A caveat: human advancement
is not automatic and cannot withstand complacency. It has a precondition
without which all that is written here may be ignored. That precondition is
liberty, specifically, the individual's right to think, to produce, to trade,
and to profit from his achievements. In institutional terms, liberty consists
in free markets, the rule of law protecting property and contracts, and strict
limits on government power. Civilization's successes have another thing in
common in addition to growing populations: capitalism. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
