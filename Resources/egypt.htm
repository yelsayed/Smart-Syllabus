<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:16.0pt">Hymn to the <st1:place w:st="on">Nile</st1:place>
(Egyptian, c. 2100 BC)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style="margin-right:.5in">Hail to thee, O Nile! Who manifests thyself over
this land, and comes to give life to <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Egypt</st1:place></st1:country-region>! Mysterious is thy issuing
forth from the darkness, on this day whereon it is celebrated! Watering the
orchards created by Re [sun god and creator of the earth], to cause all the
cattle to live, you give the earth to drink, inexhaustible one! Path that
descends from the sky, loving the bread of <span class="SpellE">Seb</span> [an
earth god] and the first-fruits of <span class="SpellE">Nepera</span>, You cause
the workshops of <span class="SpellE">Ptah</span> [god associated with craftsmen]
to prosper!</p>

<p style="margin-right:.5in">Lord of the fish, during the inundation, no bird
alights on the crops. You create the <span class="GramE">grain,</span> you bring
forth the barley, assuring perpetuity to the temples. If you cease your toil
and your work, then all that exists is in anguish. If the gods suffer in
heaven, then the faces of men waste away.</p>

<p style="margin-right:.5in">Then He [the Nile] torments the flocks of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Egypt</st1:place></st1:country-region>, and
great and small are in agony. But all is changed for mankind when He comes; He
is endowed with the qualities of Nun [the god of the watery abyss, before the
creation of the earth]. If He shines, the earth is <span class="GramE">joyous,</span>
every stomach is full of rejoicing, every spine is happy, every jaw-bone
crushes (its food).</p>

<p style="margin-right:.5in">He brings the offerings, as chief of provisioning;
He is the creator of all good things, as master of energy, full of sweetness in
his choice. If offerings are made it is thanks to Him. He brings forth the herbage
for the flocks, and sees that each god receives his sacrifices. All that
depends on Him is <span class="GramE">a precious</span> incense. He spreads
himself over <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Egypt</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
filling the granaries, renewing the marts, watching over the goods of the
unhappy.</p>

<p style="margin-right:.5in">He is prosperous to the height of all desires,
without fatiguing Himself <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>. He brings again
his lordly bark; He is not sculptured in stone, in the statutes crowned with
the <span class="SpellE">uraeus</span> serpent, He cannot be contemplated. No <span class="GramE">servitors has</span> He, no bearers of offerings! He is not enticed
by incantations! None knows the place where He <span class="GramE">dwells,</span>
none discovers his retreat by the power of a written spell.</p>

<p style="margin-right:.5in">No dwelling (is there) which may contain you! None
penetrates within your heart! Your young men, your children applaud you and
render unto you royal homage. Stable are your decrees for <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Egypt</st1:place></st1:country-region> before
your servants of the North! He stanches the water from all eyes and watches
over the increase of his good things.</p>

<p style="margin-right:.5in">Where misery existed, joy manifests itself; all
beasts rejoice<span class="GramE">..</span> […] No more reservoirs for watering
the fields! He makes mankind valiant, enriching some, bestowing his love on
others. None commands at the same time as himself. He creates the offerings
without the aid of <span class="SpellE">Neith</span> [goddess of water?], making
mankind for himself with multiform care.</p>

<p style="margin-right:.5in">* * *</p>

<p style="margin-right:.5in">A festal song is raised for you on the harp, with
the accompaniment of the hand. Your young men and your children acclaim you and
prepare their (long) exercises. You are the august ornament of the earth,
letting your bark advance before men, lifting up the heart of women in labor,
and loving the multitude of the flocks.</p>

<p style="margin-right:.5in">When you shine in the royal city, the rich man is
sated with good things, the poor man even disdains the lotus; all that is
produced is of the choicest; all the plants exist for your children. If you
have refused (to grant) nourishment, the dwelling is silent, devoid of all that
is good, the country falls exhausted.</p>

<p style="margin-right:.5in">O inundation of the <st1:place w:st="on">Nile</st1:place>,
offerings are made unto you, men are immolated to you, <span class="GramE">great</span>
festivals are instituted for you. Birds are sacrificed to you, gazelles are
taken for you in the mountain, <span class="GramE">pure</span> flames are
prepared for you. Sacrifice is made to every god as it is made to the <st1:place w:st="on">Nile</st1:place>. The Nile has made its retreats in <st1:place w:st="on">Southern
 Egypt</st1:place>, its name is not known beyond the <span class="SpellE">Tuau</span>.
The god manifests not his forms, He baffles all conception.</p>

<p style="margin-right:.5in">Men exalt him like the cycle of the <span class="GramE">gods,</span> they dread him who creates the heat, even him who has
made his son the universal master in order to give prosperity to <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region w:st="on">Egypt</st1:country-region></st1:place>.
Come (and) prosper! Come (and) prosper! O Nile, come (and) prosper! O you who
make men to live through his flocks and his flocks through his orchards! Come
(and) prosper, come, O Nile, come (and) prosper!</p>

murmured against Him. Soon, there were plots among mankind to seize the Throne
of Re. The plotters met in secret on the edge of the desert, and thought
themselves safe. However, the Sun God knew of the traitors and listened to
their plotting. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

all come secretly. If the traitors learn that I <span class="GramE">hath</span>

24.0pt;margin-left:0in"><span style="color:black">Watery Nun spoke first,
"My son, Thou art older than Thy father, greater than the God who created <span class="GramE">You</span>. May you rule forever! Both Gods and men fear the
terrible power of the Eye of the Sun; send it against the rebels." <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:24.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
24.0pt;margin-left:0in"><span style="color:black">Re looked out over <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Egypt</st1:place></st1:country-region> and
spoke, "The plotters have already fled deep into the desert. They are
afraid that I might learn of their plans and punish them. How shall I pursue
them?" <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:24.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
24.0pt;margin-left:0in"><span style="color:black">The Gods cried out with one
voice, "Send the Eye of Re to seize them! Send the Eye of the Sun to
slaughter them! All of mankind is guilty, let the Eye go down as <span class="SpellE">Hathor</span> and destroy the children of <span class="GramE">Your</span>
tears. Let not one man remain alive." <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:24.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
24.0pt;margin-left:0in"><span class="SpellE"><span style="color:black">Hathor</span></span><span style="color:black">, the Eye of the Sun, most beautiful and terrible of
Goddesses, bowed before the throne and Re and nodded His head. <span class="SpellE">Hathor</span> went down into the desert, raging like a lioness.
The plotters attempted to escape <span class="GramE">Her</span> wrath, but to no
avail. She <span class="SpellE">siezed</span> them and slaughtered them and drank
their blood. Then merciless <span class="SpellE">Hathor</span> left the desert and
raged through villages and towns, killing every man, woman, and child She could
find. Re heard the prayers and screams of the dying and felt compassion for the
children of His tears, but He remained silent. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:24.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
24.0pt;margin-left:0in"><span style="color:black">When darkness fell, <span class="SpellE">Hathor</span> returned triumphantly to <span class="GramE">Her</span>
father. "Welcome in peace," declared <span class="GramE">Re</span>. He
tried to calm the fury of His daughter, but <span class="SpellE">Hathor</span>
had tasted the blood of men and found it sweet. She was eager for the morning
when <span class="GramE">She</span> could return to <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region w:st="on">Egypt</st1:country-region></st1:place> and complete the slaughter of
mankind to avenge their treachery. Soon, the power of Re would be unquestioned,
but He would have no subjects to rule. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:24.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
24.0pt;margin-left:0in"><span style="color:black">The Sun God wondered how He
could save mankind, as He could not go back on His Divine Word. Soon, he
created a plan to halt His terrible daughter. He ordered His followers to run,
swifter than the shadows, to the city of <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Abu</st1:place></st1:city>
and bring back all the ochre they could find there. When they had returned with
baskets full of red soil, He sent them out again to fetch the High Priest of
Re, from <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Memphis</st1:place></st1:city>,
and all the slave girls who worked in his temple. Re ordered the High Priest to
pound the ochre to make a red dye and set the slave girls to brewing beer. Just
before dawn, the red dye was mixed with the beer until it looked like fresh
blood. The King of the Gods smiled. "With this sleeping potion mankind
will be rescued from <span class="GramE">My</span> daughter," He said.
"The people have suffered enough." <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:24.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
24.0pt;margin-left:0in"><span style="color:black">Re had the jars carried to
the place where <span class="SpellE">Hathor</span> would begin <span class="GramE">Her</span>
killing and ordered the beer to be poured out to flood the fields with crimson.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:24.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
24.0pt;margin-left:0in"><span style="color:black">As soon as it was light, <span class="SpellE">Hathor</span> came down into <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Egypt</st1:place></st1:country-region> to sniff out and slaughter
the few who were left alive. The first thing <span class="GramE">She</span> saw
was a great pool of blood. The Goddess waded into it and was enchanted by <span class="GramE">Her</span> own reflection in the crimson surface. She stooped to
lap up the blood and drank the pool dry. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:24.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
24.0pt;margin-left:0in"><span style="color:black">The beer was strong, and the
Goddess soon became very happy. Her head whirled and <span class="GramE">She</span>
could not remember why She had been sent into <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region w:st="on">Egypt</st1:country-region></st1:place>. <span class="SpellE">Hathor</span>
made <span class="GramE">Her</span> way back to the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:placetype w:st="on">palace</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename w:st="on">Re</st1:placename></st1:place>
and sank down at Her father's feet to sleep for many days. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

"Mankind shall remember their escape from <span class="GramE">Your</span>
fury by drinking strong beer at all Your festivals." <span class="SpellE">Hathor</span>
was known from then on as The Lady of Drunkenness. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:24.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
24.0pt;margin-left:0in"><span style="color:black">But Re was still angry and
saddened over the rebellion of mankind. Nothing would be as it once was in the
Golden Age before their treachery. When <span class="SpellE">Hathor</span>
finally awoke, <span class="GramE">She</span> felt as She had never felt before.
Re asked <span class="GramE">Her</span>, "Dost Thy head ache? Dost Thy
cheeks burn? Dost Thou feel ill?" As He spoke, illness first came into
being in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Egypt</st1:place></st1:country-region>.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:24.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
24.0pt;margin-left:0in"><span style="color:black">Then Re summoned a second
council of the Gods and spoke, "My heart is too weary for <span class="GramE">Me</span> to remain as King of Egypt. I am weak and <span class="GramE">old,</span> let Me sink back into the Watery Abyss until it is time
for Me to be born again." <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:24.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:24.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
24.0pt;margin-left:0in"><span style="color:black">"How can I carry the
mighty King of the Gods?" asked gentle <span class="SpellE">Nuit</span>, and
Nun told <span class="GramE">Her</span> to turn Herself into a cow. And so <span class="SpellE">Nuit</span> was turned into a vast cow with golden flanks and long
curved horns. Re mounted the Divine Cow, and rode away from <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region w:st="on">Egypt</st1:country-region></st1:place>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
